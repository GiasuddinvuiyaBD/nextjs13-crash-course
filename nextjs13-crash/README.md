## Routing system next13
In next13 route work a little bit different. Suppose we want to create a about page route. For making about page route at first we have to create a folder and then we have to create a file calle index.js or index.jsx.
Every custom route we have to create folder name not a file.

> Note : We can't add class inside the link. Like <Link className={about.module.css}></Link>
> When we need to use any class for designing or any other thing in that time we need to use a tag. 

## Layout part
If i want to show something all out application. For this perpose we use layout file in nexjs13. 

## Matadata API.
Inside the matadata we can set global data like title,descript and api related data which will be globel. 

> Note : If we want change some special pages data or title,descript, api etc. For this we can matadata for the specific page.
